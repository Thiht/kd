# kd
kd stands for Klass Diagram. In some programming languages, the spelling "klass" is sometimes used instead of "class" to name a variable when the latter is already used as a syntactic keyword, that's why I decided to go with this name. Also kd sounds kool.

kd's goal is to generate class diagrams for the web from a simple language. Ultimately, it should be embeddable as simply as [Mathjax](http://www.mathjax.org/) and generate SVG or canvas or HTML or image or all of these (I didn't decide yet) in a clean way. Due to its strict syntax, it should also be able to generate arbitrary code (Java, C++, PHP, etc.).

kd uses [Jison](http://zaach.github.io/jison/) to generate the language parser.

**This project is currently a WIP and far from usable.**

## Example codes
### Simplest class declaration
    | ClassName

### Class with attributes
    | ClassName
        - privateAttr: int
        # protectedAttribute: int
        ~ packageAttribute: int
        + publicAttribute: int
        +_ publicStaticAttribute: int
        -/ privateDerivedAttr: int
        -/_ privateDerivedStaticAttribute: int
        - array: int[10]
        - list: int[1..*]

### Class with operations
    | ClassName
        <<constructor>> +_ ClassName(): ClassName
        - privateMethod(): void
        + abstractMethod(): void {abstract}
        + publicMethodWithParams(param1: int, paramList: int[*]): int

### Class with stereotype
    | <<interface>> ClassName

### Class with constraint
    | ClassName {abstract}

### Template class
    | TemplateClass[key:K, value:V]

## Features
### Implemented
* Class declaration
    - Simple class
    - Template class
    - Stereotype
    - Constraint
* Attribute declaration
    - Stereotype
    - Visibility
    - Derivable/Classifier
    - Name
    - Type
    - Constraint
    - Multiplicity
* Operation declaration
    - Stereotype
    - Visibility
    - Derivable/Classifier
    - Name
    - Type
    - Parameters (including multiplicity)
    - Constraint

### To do
* **Attribute the grammar**
    - Native support of `<<interface>>`
        + if a class has this stereotypes, all its operations become abstract
    - Native support of `<<constructor>>`
        + its name must match the class name
        + its return value must be the same as the class name
        + it's static
    - Native support of `{abstract}`
        + if a method is abstract, the class is set as abstract
* **Diagram generation**
* Attributes
    - default value
* Operation parameters
    - default value
    - direction? (`in`, `out`, `inout`)
* Package
    - the standard syntax is `Package1::...::PackageN::ClassName` but it will hardly be possible to follow it exactly
* Notes/comments
    - Syntax: `"comment goes here"`
* Relations
    - Support of inheritance with `extends` and implementation with `implements`
    - Smart relations when a class A has an attribute of type B and B is defined in the diagram
    - Other relations with a sub-grammar (ie. `ClassA [0..1]---[*] ClassB`)

## Notes and limitations
1. The difference between [stereotypes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_%28UML%29) and [classifiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifier_%28UML%29) won't be made since they both use the same syntax.
2. Only one stereotype at most can be used per class/member, because I don't know if the standard allows multiple stereotypes. It's easy to change though.
3. You **have to** specify a return type to an operation, even if it's simply void.
4. For parsing reasons, the visibility is always mandatory.
